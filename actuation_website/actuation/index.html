													<h3><a href="#">Abstract</a></h3>
													<p>The Emulation of Aerospace Actuation Systems Project is an effort funded by <a href="https://www.woodward.com/home">Woodward, Inc.</a> to validate an electrical drive alternative to replace the pneumatically/hydraulically operated Thrust Reverser Actuation Systems (TRAS) currently deployed on commercial and military aircraft. This project will interface a TI TMS320C2000 microcontroller with an OPAL-RT real-time processor to emulate several electrically driven aerospace actuation scenarios using a controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) platform. Team members will program both the TI board and the OPAL-RT system in C to read/write synchronized digital and analog signals that reflect the behavior of real mechanical motors and drive systems located in a physical testbed at the Aerospace System Emulation and Test (ASET) Lab at the CSU Powerhouse. The team will also design a printed circuit board and wiring harness to facilitate seamless interaction between the TI board and the OPAL-RT system. Finally, the team will produce a detailed system model of the code and associated hardware using the principles of Model Based Systems Engineering in Cameo Systems Modeler. The overall product to Woodward, Inc. is a well-documented system model and thoroughly tested code package that can safely interface with the ASET testbed for the next phase of project validation.</p>

													<h3><a href="#">Project Background</a></h3>
													<p>The key motivation of this senior design project is to provide the aerospace industry with more electric aircraft. More Electric Aircraft (MEA) is a concept in the aerospace industry that is driven by demands such as optimizing aircraft performance, decreasing operating and maintenance costs while also reducing fuel consumption and gas emissions (Yitao Liu et. al., 2018). This project is focused on electrifying secondary energy sources in aircraft, specifically, the currently hydraulic-driven thrust reversers on aircraft nacelle. Currently there are a few companies working on replacing the hydraulic driven thrust reversers with electric driven ones such as Honeywell and Collins Aerospace. While there are companies that have been working with similar goals, Woodward, Inc. has a long-standing position in the aerospace industry creating Thrust Reverser Actuation Systems dating back to the 1960s. With the expertise of Woodward, Inc. in combination with our senior design team, we aim to produce state of the art solutions to push the aerospace industry one step further towards fully electric aircraft. </p>
													<p>This senior design project is a continuation project in collaboration with Woodward, Inc., with the goal of creating a testbed for validating an Electromechanical Thrust Reverser Actuation System (EM-TRAS). Previous work on this project yielded a physical testbed for emulating the EM-TRAS system, but before this testbed can be used to perform simulations, we will work on creating a validation system using a real time simulator and microcontroller to perform a Controller-Hardware-In-the-Loop (CHIL) experiment. </p>

													<h3><a href="#">Constraints</a></h3>
																										<ul>
														✈ The TI microcontroller can only accept voltage inputs between 0-3.3 V<br> 
														✈ The TI microcontroller operates at 50 kHZ<br> 
														✈ The TI microcontroller requires code written in C, which a lower level language that inherently requires more rigorous coding practices and debugging<br>
														✈ There is a lack of documentation on how to interface with and use the microcontoller, requiring the team to spend additional hours researching<br>
														✈ The OPAL-RT interface is not well defined and has limited support<br>
													</article></ul>
													</article>
												</li>
												<li>
													<p><b>Primary Objectives:</br></b>
													<em>Note: These objectives are directly required by the customer for the successful completion of this project:</em><br>
													<ul>
														✈ Determine the analog and digital I/O requirements for the microcontroller and OPAL-RT<br>
														✈ Develop C code for running a closed-loop CHIL experiment, where the OPAL-RT executes a real-time DC machine system model <br>
														✈ Run the closed-loop CHIL experiment with set failure modes as described in the proprietary document and collect measurement information <br>
														✈ Document the design steps and experimental results in a test report to be delivered to the customer<br>
														✈ Include system requirements flow-through and design information on the CHIL platform in the existing Cameo repository for the testbed<br> 
													</article></ul>
													<p><b>Secondary Objectives:</br></b>
													<em>Note: these objectives are not directly required by the customer, but are being pursued by the senior design team to increase readability and overall functionality of the end product: </em><br>
													<ul>
														✈ Design a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to represent the current state of the testbed during all tests as well as error codes that are flagged during these tests and the system’s real-time response to mitigate these errors <br>
														✈ Create a script to parse through the microcontroller code and establish code coverage of all conditional branches to ensure that all code is being thoroughly tested and verified before official hand-off to the customer for interface with the physical testbed <br>
														✈ Run a documentation tool (e.g. Doxygen) on the finished code to extract an HTML report of all code documentation and increase readability/ease of understanding for the customer upon official hand-off at the end of the project period  <br>
